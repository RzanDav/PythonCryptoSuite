# 🔐 All-in-One Python Crypto Suite

A comprehensive Python-based cryptography suite combining classical and modern encryption techniques in a single CLI application.

Originally developed for a Computer Security course, this project is shared for educational and reference purposes.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This tool provides a unified environment for learning and experimenting with cryptography, from classical ciphers to modern encryption algorithms used in real-world security.

---

## 🧩 Features

### 🔸 Classical Ciphers

* Caesar Cipher
* Vigenère Cipher
* Playfair Cipher

### 🔸 Core Cryptographic Components

* P-Box (Permutation Box)
* S-Box (Substitution Box + Inverse)
* AES ShiftRows demonstration

### 🔸 Modern Cryptography

* DES (ECB / CBC modes)
* AES (128 / 192 / 256-bit keys)
* RSA (Key generation, encryption, decryption)

---

## 🛠 Built With

* Python 3
* PyCryptodome
* hashlib
* base64

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

### 2️⃣ Run the program:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* DES and ECB mode are included for learning purposes only.
* AES and RSA are implemented using PyCryptodome.
* The application is entirely CLI-based, with a unified main menu for ease of use.
